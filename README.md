## Setup an account with TMDB

[Sign Up](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) for an account with 'The Movie Database.'

Once you are logged in you can go to _settings_ -> [_api_](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and create an api application. You can make it a personal application and if you need to provide a website and you don't have one you can create a github page to use.
